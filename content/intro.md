## Events: Flexible and efficient state synchronization
- Publish/subscribe decouples producer from consumers <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" -->
- Stream of single events leads to timely sync <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->
- Consumer logic is simplified by focusing on atomic changes  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-up" -->

## Title: Bridging Data-Oriented Programming, Domain-Driven Design, and Knowledge Graphs for Software Developers

---

## Introduction
- Importance of data modeling in software development.
- Relevance of knowledge graphs in modern applications.
- Contribution of data modeling, knowledge graphs, and enterprise architecture to efficient, scalable, and maintainable applications.

---

## Fundamentals of Data Modeling
### What is Data Modeling?
- Definition and purpose.
- Bridging real-world scenarios and software implementation.

### Types of Data Models
- Conceptual, logical, and physical data models.
- Scope and level of detail.

### Entities and Attributes
- Entities as objects or concepts.
- Attributes as entity properties.
- Examples.

---

## Data-Oriented Programming
### Understanding DOP
- Paradigm emphasizing data manipulation.
- Benefits for performance and optimization.

### DOP Techniques and Practices
- Cache optimization, data locality, parallelism.
- Complementing data modeling.

---

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
### Introduction to DDD
- Aligning software design with business domains.
- Importance of domain understanding and modeling.

### Ubiquitous Language and Bounded Contexts
- Communication with a consistent language.
- Isolated domains with their models and logic.

### Aggregates and Entities
- Aggregates as consistency boundaries.
- Entities in domain object modeling.

---

## Introduction to Knowledge Graphs
### What are Knowledge Graphs?
- Characteristics and roles.
- Representing complex relationships and structured data.

### Knowledge Graphs vs. Traditional Data Models
- Contrasting with relational databases.
- Capturing semantic relationships.

---

## Building Knowledge Graphs
### Nodes, Edges, and Properties
- Nodes as entities, edges as relationships.
- Properties as attributes.

### Ontologies and Schemas
- Defining structure using ontologies.
- Enabling context-aware connections.

### Querying Knowledge Graphs
- Brief overview of SPARQL.
- Simple query example.

---

## Integrating DOP with DDD
### Benefits of Integration
- Performance, maintainability, organization.
- Enhanced development through synergy.

### Use Case
- Illustration of DOP enhancing DDD.
- Efficient data processing within bounded contexts.

---

## Best Practices, Tools, and Frameworks
### Best Practices
- Clear modeling, meaningful relationships.
- Aligning models with DOP and DDD principles.

### Tools and Frameworks
- Neo4j, caching libraries, DDD frameworks.
- Enhancing development using these approaches.

---

## Conclusion
- Recap of data modeling, knowledge graphs, enterprise architecture, DOP, and DDD.
- The impact of integration on application quality, interoperability, and maintainability.

---

## Q&A Session
- Open discussion on data modeling, knowledge graphs, enterprise architecture, DOP, DDD, and practical application in software development.
